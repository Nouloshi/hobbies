I love swimming.I started to get trained for swimming in the age of 4 while I was living in Chennai.After that when we shifted to Delhi I started continuing my training in JNU campus as a begginer.Then after sometime when my father realised that I was capable of swimming by myself he asked my teachers to move my position in the seniors pool where I can practice by myself so that is how I loved and learnt swimming!!</p>
